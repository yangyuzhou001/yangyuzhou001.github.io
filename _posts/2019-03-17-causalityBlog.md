The definition of Causality must satisfy three conditions: First, variables must have correlations; Second, two variables must have a time order; Third, variabels' relation cannot be explained by another variables. Let's talk about the Second Conditions. Actually, we cannot find an accurate definition of Time. The epistemological problem of time can be date back to David Hume. Physically speaking, the arrow of time we usually used is based on the thermodynamic arrow of time. By the second law of thermodynamics, the total entropy of an isolated system can never decrease over time, we realize that the past and the future never be symmetric. But the definition has a paradox: We must realize the Total Entropy's increase by time, and we regard the Total Entropy's increas as time! "Increase" is a change that is defined in time. Actually, we can only find a relative time in Physics.
If we know nothing about time, how can we know anything about causality?
